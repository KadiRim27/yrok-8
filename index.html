                    Success is the ability to realize your goals and find ways to achieve them. For some people, this is
                    a luxurious life, a
                    trip to expensive restaurants and similar expensive values, and for others, a sense of importance

                    surroundings. We have collected the best motivational statements, beautiful phrases and wise

                            Sadness is a negatively colored emotion. Occurs in the case of significant dissatisfaction
                            with a person in any aspects
                            of his life. The concept of sadness is considered to be the opposite of joy and is close in
                            meaning to words such as
                            sadness, longing, despondency, sorrow, kruchina, melancholy. Sometimes these words are
                            considered synonyms.

                            In the
                            clinical state, sadness turns into depressive states of the body. This can lead to constant
                            bouts of melancholy, bad
                            mood, inability to do ordinary everyday things.

                            Each of us has bad days when everything goes awry. But do not let them appear in your life
                            too often, so that they do
                            not affect your mood, as well as the mood of your loved ones. When we set ourselves up for
                            something bad, as a result,
                            this bad thing is likely to happen. But remember that all bad things will pass sometime. As
                            they say, time heals.
